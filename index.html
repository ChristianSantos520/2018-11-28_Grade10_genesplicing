            <h3><strong>What is Gene Splicing?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Gene splicing is when certain sections of genes or genomes are inserted into a
                different genome, which is in a different living organism.  Gene splicing happens
                before mRNA translation in eukaryotic cells and is part of genetic engineering.  In
                the DNA, the enzymes will act as the cutting tool that removes a section of the DNA.
                Later, a new part of DNA, that was removed from another gene, will attach to fill
                the empty spot, completing the DNA.  Another kind of enzyme, which is called ligase,
                will act as the gluing tool so the DNA will not fall apart.  The purpose of this
                process is to change the DNA code so that when the DNA is read, the function of what
                the DNA is used for will change.  For example, there might be a defect in the DNA
                and the process of gene splicing will fix this defect, possibly improving the health
                of the organism if it is successful.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>How is Gene Splicing Helping the Advancement of Genetic Research?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Every week a Canadian dies from cystic fibrosis, which mainly affects the lungs and
                immune system.  Using genetic splicing, scientists can conduct research on cystic
                fibrosis, since gene splicing naturally occurs and cystic fibrosis is caused when an
                error happens in the gene splicing.  Many other kinds of disorders come from
                splicing.  Scientists know what happens normally in gene splicing and their idea is
                to focus on what can go wrong in gene splicing.  Therefore, this research will allow
                them to gain knowledge for many other diseases.
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Problems and Difficulties</strong></h3>
            <p>
                If gene splicing is not done right, it will lead to mutations that could lead to
                disease.  When the error happens, it is very difficult to fix.  Scientists may need
                to change or fix 40 to 50 amino acids, which makes up one protein.  Another problem
                with gene splicing is that theologians are concerned about the ethics of gene
                splicing, by allowing scientists to design organisms the way they want.  For
                example, if parents want their child to be taller, they could ask scientists to
                alter their child’s genes.  The result would be an alteration in the increase of
                height.  Theologians say that gene splicing is like “playing God”.  The Synagogue
                Council of America, the United States Catholic Conference, and the National Council
                of Churches are especially concerned about this because scientists are changing the
                meaning of the “image of God”.  Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in
                our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the
                sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals. and over all the creatures that
                move along the ground.” <em>Genesis 1:26 (NIV Version).</em>
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Latest Project and Discoveries</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Using gene splicing, by removing unnecessary sections in the DNA and replacing them
                with better ones, can help an organism.  There is a type of gene splicing called
                CRISPR, which makes the process cheap and quick.  CRISPR (Clusters of Regularly
                Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) takes a few days to complete, and only costs
                thirty dollars.  This gene editing process uses some bacteria that can defend
                themselves from viruses by having a gene-editing mechanism.  These kinds of bacteria
                use an enzyme called Cas9 to use as scissors.  These bacteria cut out certain genes
                from viruses and stores them in their own immune system.  CRISPR can provide a cure
                for sickle cell anemia and muscular dystrophy.  This advancement in technology is
                already in use for making crops invulnerable to harmful fungi and making mosquitos
                not pass down malaria to the next generation of mosquitos 99.5 percent of the time.
                However, the most successful use of CRISPR is the process of curing heredity
                diseases.  Therefore, people should stop wishing to use gene splicing to create
                every organism they want, but use gene splicing to help cure diseases.
